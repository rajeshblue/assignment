Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment
This repo contains my solution to the Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment (see description below).

Simply execute "run_analysis.R". If the data is not on the same folder, the script automatically downloads and extract it in the right place. If you already have downloaded the data, extract the zip file inside the same folder than the script. Just to be clear, the relative path compared to "run_analysis.R" of the "activity_labels.txt" file should be "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt" for instance.
